# Analog 24h Clock Plasmoid

The idea of the clock is based on the 24-hour Android Widget from 
Steve Pomeroy (http://staticfree.info/projects/24h_clock/).

It uses code from 
* the original KDE Plasma Clock (https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Clocks)
* the 24hAnalogWidget (https://github.com/xxv/24hAnalogWidget)
* jSunTimes (http://www.jstott.me.uk/jsuntimes/)
